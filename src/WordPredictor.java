     * Constructs a WordPredictor with the provided probability map and random number generator.
     * 
     * In probs, each key is a word and the value is a list of words that could possibly follow it.
     * Each word is stored along with its cumulative probability.
     * The cumulative probability is the probability in the range (0, 1.] that this word
     * or any of the preceding words in the list of possibilities should be chosen.
     * The probabilities must be in strictly ascending order and the final probability
     * must be 1.0. There can be no empty lists.
     * 
     * Example: 
     * { 
     *   the: [[cat, .1], [dog, .5], [lizard, 1.0]],
     *   cat: [[sat, .6], [ate, 1.0]]
     * }
     * In this example:
     * there is a 10% chance that "cat" follows "the" (.1)
     * there is a 40% chance that "dog" follows "the" (.5-.1=.4)
     * there is a 50% chance that "lizard" follows "the" (1.-.5=.5)
     *
     * there is a 40% chance "ate" follows ""cat" (1.-.6=.4)
     * there is a 60% chance "sat" follows "cat" (.6)
     *
     * Validates the map structure before initializing.
     *
     * @param probs a map where each key is a word and the value is a non empty list of WordProbability entries
